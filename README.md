# Kinematic-modeling-for-hyperloop

## A rough work on paper showing the v-t graph which represents the 3 phases of the hyperloop

## 1. Accelerate

### This is the how the pod starts. Here, when we want to reach a certain speed in a given distance, **What** should our acceleration be? This answers that


## 2. Cruise

### After attaining the cruise speed, we reach this stage in which the pod stays for the maximum time. This shows **how** much distance can be covered between point A and B when my factors speed and time are varied.


## 3. Deccelerate

### Also known as crash equation. Here, when we know a foreign object is at a certain distance and colliding could cause an accident or we near a station, we are already at a certain speed, So, **What** is the optimum decceleration needed so that the pod stops before it without over-braking and making it uncomfortble for the passengers.

## Tools used:

### **Python 3.x**
### **NumPy**: For numerical operations and creating the data arrays.
### **Matplotlib**: For generating the 3D surface plots.
